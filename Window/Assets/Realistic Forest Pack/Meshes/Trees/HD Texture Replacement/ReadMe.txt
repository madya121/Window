HD TEXTURE REPLACEMENT

These textures are intented as a replacement for textures generated by Unity Tree Creator.
The generated textures are low resolution (1024x1024) and as such they impact negatively 
the visual quality of the trees.

In order to use the replacement textures:

- copy diffuse.png and normal_specular.png files from one of the tree folders (eg. Oak)

- navigate to the texture folder of the tree you want to replace (eg. Meshes/Trees/oak_1_Textures)

- paste an override the existing textures

- in the Import Settings of the replaced textures set Max Size to your desired resolution 
(4096 is max with the exception of birch textures which are 2048)
